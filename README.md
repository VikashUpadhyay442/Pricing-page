## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind

### What I learned

The new thing i learned, besides just revising and being better in HTML and tailwind, would be using <details> and <summary> tags and other would be adding different images and svg in list starting in tailwind.
